Exception: 
 It looks like you are trying to call a SeleniumBase method
 from outside the scope of your test class's `self` object,
 which is initialized by calling BaseCase's setUp() method.
 The `self` object is where all test variables are defined.
 If you created a custom setUp() method (that overrided the
 the default one), make sure to call super().setUp() in it.
 When using page objects, be sure to pass the `self` object
 from your test class into your page object methods so that
 they can call BaseCase class methods with all the required
 variables, which are initialized during the setUp() method
 that runs automatically before all tests called by pytest.
